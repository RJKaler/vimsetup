"This goes in /etc/vim/vimrc which is the global non-user vim config 

" $VIMRUNTIME refers to the versioned system directory where Vim stores its
" system runtime files -- /usr/share/vim/vim<version>.
"
" Vim will load $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim if the user does not have a vimrc.
" This happens after /etc/vim/vimrc(.local) are loaded, so it will override
" any settings in these files.
"
" If you don't want that to happen, uncomment the below line to prevent
" defaults.vim from being loaded.
" let g:skip_defaults_vim = 1
"
" If you would rather _use_ default.vim's settings, but have the system or
" user vimrc override its settings, then uncomment the line below.
" source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim

" All Debian-specific settings are defined in $VIMRUNTIME/debian.vim and
" sourced by the call to :runtime you can find below.  If you wish to change
" any of those settings, you should do it in this file or
" /etc/vim/vimrc.local, since debian.vim will be overwritten everytime an
" upgrade of the vim packages is performed. It is recommended to make changes
" after sourcing debian.vim so your settings take precedence.

" NOTE: debian.vim sets 'nocompatible'.  Setting 'compatible' changes
" numerous options, so any other options should be set AFTER changing
" 'compatible'.
